# COVID-19 Workers Risk (Impacto COVID-19)

Research project in partnership with the Laboratory of the Future (http://labfuturo.cos.ufrj.br/) of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (COPPE/UFRJ).

Project focused on the dissemination of COVID-19 related studies in Brazil (PT-BR), among them, an analysis of workers contamination risk by occupation considering different characteristics (e.g., exposure to diseases, physical proximity) related to formal jobs based on crossing data from Brazil and the USA.

## COVID-19 pandemic

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age.
